##Motivation
Cryptocurrency is a decentralised and secure form of digital cash transactions which has taken the 
world by storm. Cryptocurrency is largely driven by young tech savvy millennials who are extremely active on social media. Bitcoin just like any other traded currency relies heavily on market speculation. Apart from the traditional sources of media namely news articles and television with the rise of Bitcoin we see a new source of information that is social media. 

Bitcoin being extremely volatile makes it harder to predict. We aim to use the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) which states that stock market prices are largely driven by new information and follow a random walk pattern.By incorporating social media as  an additional channel of information we can better emulate the speculative patterns of the traders. For example the fall in prices of bitcoin with the Chinese regulatorâ€™s decision to bad all virtual currency and its subsequent rise when the government decided to soften its stands.
